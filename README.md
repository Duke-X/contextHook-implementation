# Context - Hook Implementation

- Here, we specified how to create a contextHook.
- Initialize the state variables in a Provider, and mention the children in it
- Create a parent function and initialize the functions which will use the state variables in the Provider.
- Create the required functions, and initialize the state variables like const {variable} = useContext(Context_intialized_at_beginning)
- Put the Parent function in the App function and export it.
